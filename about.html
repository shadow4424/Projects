            <summary>How is this different from A-levels or Sixth form</summary>
            <p>Those of you who have taken computer science in your A-levels or previous education may find the content taught through these courses to be a little different. In previous learning you may have learned more about specific applications and programming languages, however, thorughout your studies in foundation year you will learn more about the application of computational thinking. This way no matter the previous experience you have in computer science, whether it be a lot or a little, you will still learn how to adopt a better computational thinking mindset.</p>

            <summary>Who are we?</summary>
            <p>We are a group of foundation year students at the University of Manchester who have studied the computational thinking course and project unit. We used the skills we learned in both those units to create a website that might better help you prepare for the tasks and challenges we faced through the computer science foundation year. </p>

                <summary>What new skills we have learned?</summary>
                <p>The skills that our group developed and learned throughout this year differed among the indivdual members of our group. Some of us already had a stronger background from previous learning and some of us were less experienced in the topics covered. So, the level at which our skills improved varied, however, all of us were able to take away and learn from some very key ideas that were taught this year. Those are the main points that are mentioned in our content page regarding algorithms, abstraction, algorithm complexity and recursion. These are the key ideas we felt were most important and thus we wanted to pass on to those who are taking the foundation year.</p>

                    <summary>Our personal feelings on computational thinking?</summary>
                    <p>What we feel as a group about the concept of computational thinking and the various ideas and topics taught in the foundation year for computer science is that those concepts and computational thinking as a whole better prepared us on the right mindset to approaching the problems and concepts regarding computer science such as algorithms.</p>
