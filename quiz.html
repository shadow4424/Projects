    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Computational Thinking</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Computational thinking is a problem-solving approach that is becoming increasingly important in today's digital world. It involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, and using algorithms and logical thinking to develop a solution.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you're a first-year university student studying computer science, you will likely encounter computational thinking in various courses. Here are some key concepts to help you prepare for a quiz on the topic:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> This refers to the process of identifying important details and ignoring unnecessary ones. For example, when writing a program to calculate the area of a circle, you may abstract away the details of how pi is calculated and just use a pre-defined value.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> These are step-by-step instructions for solving a problem. They can be expressed in a variety of ways, including natural language, flowcharts, and pseudocode.</li>
    <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> This is the process of breaking a complex problem down into smaller, more manageable parts. For example, if you wanted to build a website, you might break the problem down into tasks such as designing the user interface, writing the code, and testing the site.</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> This involves identifying similarities and patterns in data. For example, a program that analyzes customer data might look for patterns in their purchasing history to identify trends and make recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Abductive reasoning:</strong> This is a form of logical inference that involves making educated guesses based on incomplete information. It's often used in problem-solving, where there may not be enough information to make a definitive conclusion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">By understanding these key concepts of computational thinking, you can better approach and solve problems in computer science. Good luck with your quiz!</p>
